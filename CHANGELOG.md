# Changelog

A human-readable log of notable pushes to this repository, in reverse
chronological order — updated each time a significant push lands.
Complements `git log` and the Spec Kit artifacts
(`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `specs/`) with a narrative of how
the product and its architecture evolved.

## 2026-07-06 — Project scaffold & constitution draft

- `chore: scaffold Spec Kit project structure` — initialized `.specify/`
  (memory, scripts, templates, workflows) and `.claude/skills/` via
  GitHub Spec Kit; added the initial `.gitignore`.
- `chore: scaffold Spec Kit project structure and draft constitution`
  (`05c7749`) — drafted the Printing Website constitution v1.0.0
  (spec-driven process, full-stack substance & trustworthy commerce,
  designed/accessible UX, scope discipline, test discipline, legible
  history), adapted from a prior project's constitution but not yet
  ratified. Added `docs/adr/` (README + ADR template), `docs/future-work.md`,
  `docs/non-functional.md`, and a config scaffold (`tsconfig.json`,
  `eslint.config.mjs`, `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.nvmrc`).
- `docs: add README, status, and env scaffold` — added `README.md`,
  `status.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (this file), and `.env.example` (the only
  one of the three env files tracked in the repo); fixed a `.gitignore`
  ordering bug that would have re-ignored `.env.example` after its own
  negation rule.
